			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			<h3>Q1: What indicative trends can we deduce in the average annual value of properties for different factors?</h3>

			<figure>

				<figcaption>
                    For the residential sales dataset, my starting point was to assess any relationships between average annual values of property compared to prices. For most of the time horizon under consideration (2000-2022), the trends are similar, where an increase in average annual value corresponds to a general increase in price. Interestingly, however, both are immune to drastic changes in each other as they don't display corresponding proportionate change. For example, while there was a sharp decrease in prices in 2008-09, likely brought on by the housing market crash, the average annual value did not change respectively. In fact, there was a notable increase felt in the subsequent years. Prices are much more speculative in nature and volatile to external market trends, and similar behavior is observed here. Additionally, the drastic increase in average annual value did not proportionally raise prices as there was a 6x increase in house value in 2017, but this corresponded to only a 2x increase in price for the same year.

				<figcaption>
                    The previous graph presented interesting findings, and I wanted to explore these on their own separate merit. For prices, I was intrigued to find the density of individual sales. This result shows that most of the residential transactions hovered around the $100M mark individually, with the next highest observation in the $100M-$200M range. While reading the assigned reading <cite><a href='https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report' target='_blank'>Homes for Profit</a></cite>, my initial assumption was that Boston's prices have been high and remain outside the grasp of reasonable policy change. However, this data underscored that while most of the transactions are not astronomically priced high enough to warrant radical and perhaps unsteady policies, sustained and consistent efforts can still achieve results.

				<img src="images/Subsidized_3_YearlySales&Price.png" alt="Yearly Price Data for Institutional Investors" width="700" height="400" title="Yearly Price Data for Institutional Investors">
				<figcaption>
                    Given that I am analyzing the theme of 'Housing for the Rich' for this assignment, I wanted to explore the trends for the most affluent investor type; institutional investors. While the initial trend is consistent with the pricing trends observed in Figure 1, it is incredible to see that in recent years, institutional investors have undertaken transactions well into the billions of dollars. The years 2017-2018 saw a significant jump from previous years, buoyed perhaps by the Trump administration's tax cuts, which have since significantly dropped with the start of Biden's administration.

			<h3>Q2: For the various investor types, what do these sales signify, and in what manner do they take shape? </h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_2.png" alt="Count of Investor Transactions" width="300" height="400" Title = "Count of Investor Transactions">
				<figcaption>
                    Building off the previous analysis, I wanted to further gauge any insights found and whether the large number of transactions conducted by institutional investors corresponded with any other results. I was shocked to find that most of the transactions were undertaken by non-count investors instead of institutional investors. In fact, non-count investor purchases represented roughly 7x the combined count of all others. This seemingly contradicts the findings mentioned in the report <cite><a href='https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report' target='_blank'>Homes for Profit</a></cite>. However, my understanding is that these represent the count of actors and not the share of transactions. There must be other factors at play, and possibly institutional investors, though few in number, may conduct significantly large transactions to sway the share of purchases to be more consistent with the report's findings.
                </figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_1.png" alt="Cash Purchases" width="300" height="150" Title="Cash Purchases">
				<figcaption>
                    This chart adds further dimension to the finding above that non-count investors comprise the largest group of buyers. Consistent with my assumptions, this graph shows that non-value investors represent the largest portion of cash sales. As the Boston Globe report <cite><a href='https://apps.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/special-projects/spotlight-boston-housing/boston-towers-of-wealth/' target='_blank'>Reckoning with Boston's Towers of Wealth</a></cite> indicates, cash sales are a preferred mode of transaction for both buyers and sellers, especially individual actors. Perhaps the non-investors represent individual buyers, and while their number may be exceedingly high, their transactions frequently use cash, highlighting their aversion to, or perhaps lack of access to, large financing options.
                </figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_5.png" alt="Single Family Housing" width="650" height="350" Title="Single Family Housing" >
				<figcaption>
                    Building on the insights gathered in the previous figure, this further confirms my assumptions that institutional investors engaged mainly in mortgage sales, versus non-value investors who utilized cash sales options and represented individual buyers. I use a consistent color palette to represent investor types.
                </figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_3.png" alt="Primary Owner" width="300" height="350" Title="Primary Owner of Single-Family">
				<figcaption>
                    Next, my motivation was to understand the single-family property ownership breakup per investor type. Similar to earlier results, institutional investors are the biggest owners of single-family homes in Boston. Single-family homes represent the greatest value for property owners, as corroborated by the Boston Globe report <cite><a href='https://apps.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/special-projects/spotlight-boston-housing/boston-towers-of-wealth/' target='_blank'>Reckoning with Boston's Towers of Wealth</a></cite> regarding luxury condos. According to the report, developers are mandated to provide subsidized housing as compensation for luxury property investments. A significant part of Boston's housing is crunched because of the sale and development of single-family housing, at the expense of multiple family housing. I explore the property types and locations further under Question 3.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_4.png" alt="Subsidized Housing Ownership" width="300" height="350" Title="Subsidized Housing Ownership">
				<figcaption>
			Relatedly to the point above, this graph of ownership of subsidized housing represents the instituional investors as major owners of subsidized housing properties in Boston. While Medium investor type hold the least amount of such housing, it is worryung that small investors do not own a majority of subsidized housing. This presents risks of evictions and 
			exorbitant rates since the investors are driven by the profit motive, instituional investors primarily so, and this representation not being a democratic one can spell trouble for Boston housing market. I explore this contribution next.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_6.png" alt="Subsidized Housing Contribution" width="550" height="400" Title="Subsidized Housing Contribution">
				<figcaption>
                    To further understand the value of subsidized housing in Boston and why there has been a push from institutional investors, I wanted to explore if there were any year-wise trends. There was a considerable jump in 2013, as demonstrated by the graph. For the rest of the years, the housing values were pretty similar. Further research, as stated in the Boston Globe's 2013 report, indicated that <cite><a href='https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/02/07/massachusetts-officials-say-million-targeted-for-affordable-housing/nHjjWWcl2LBObiwtM6NSVJ/story.html' target='_blank'>$67m was allocated for Mass. affordable housing</a></cite>. This perhaps buoyed for-profit institutional investors, which might have resulted in an extremely high jump in average annual value for subsidized holdings and institutional investor ownership in such property type. I annotate on the graph to convey the amount of subsidized housing value.

			<h3>Q3: What information can property types provide us about the Boston Housing crisis, how the houses are designed, and where they are located? </h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Rich_1.png" alt="Cluster" width="700" height="400" Title="Cluster">
				<figcaption>
                    This graph shows, for each zip code, which property type is dominant in the respective zip code. Apartment buildings (APT) and Residential Condominiums (RCD) stand out as the most popular types, prominent in multiple zip codes. The majority of the APT buildings are clustered in the busy Boston Downtown areas while RCDs dominate the suburbs. Since the city center has congestion concerns, most of the high-rise buildings are found in this area, and the result is consistent with this viewpoint. Residential condos, however, being more spacious, are situated farther away.
                </figcaption>

                </figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="images/Rich_4.png" alt="Zip Codes Count" width="600" height="350" Title="Zip Codes Count">
					<figcaption>
                        While the above graph allowed me to better visualize the dataset regarding the prominence of a particular property type's dominance with respect to geography, I used this representation to showcase the detailed and numerical representation of the number of zip codes where a particular property type is present. This allows for a better comparison between different property types and shows that the majority of Boston residents prefer to own Residential Condominiums. This confirms my earlier assumptions regarding luxurious housing in Boston.
                    </figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="images/Rich_2.png" alt="Apt Buildings" width="550" height="350" Title="Apartment Buildings">
					<figcaption>
                        Further exploring the APT dataset for Boston proper, I observe that the Dorchester neighborhood has the most number of APT buildings. I've annotated on the graph for reference of property numbers. This graph shows that contrary to general perception, APT buildings are not as prominent in the frequently visited commercial areas of Boston proper such as Downtown, Park Street, North End, and Back Bay.
                    </figcaption>
				</figure>				

				<figure>
					<img src="images/Rich_3.png" alt="Bathroom to Bedroom" width="600" height="500" Title="Bathroom to Bedroom">
					<figcaption>
                        For the different property types, I was also interested in their composition, after having developed a good sense of the frequency of their presence and location in the given municipalities. This graph involved calculating the ratio of bathrooms and bedrooms to total rooms respectively for each property. It was interesting to note that the majority of the property types concentrated around 0.5, i.e., half the number of bathrooms and bedrooms to total rooms present.

                        However, R25 was a stark exception as it showcased an equal ratio of bathrooms and bedrooms to total rooms, which is 1. R25 is meant to house more than 25 residents in a building and represents a housing type that could include just a bedroom and bathroom for each of its occupants. That is, it's meant to be an affordable housing unit without the extra space/amenities enjoyed by other property types such as living rooms, dining halls, etc. What was also interesting to note is that the ratio of bathrooms to total rooms and bedrooms to total rooms was equal for all property types, indicating an adequate presence of sanitary facilities.

			<h3>Q4: How do property flips impact prices between flips, ownership horizon, and transactional behavior?</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Flips_1.png" alt="Term Flips" width="900" height="500" Title="Term Flips">
				<figcaption>
                    I started my analysis on flipped properties by trying to understand the connection of flip horizons (or terms) on the average annual value of different family size residences. Single Family and long-term flip terms significantly stand out, as expected. Most individuals and investors consider property ownership an investment, eased by rising property values.

                    It was interesting to observe that the smallest share of annual value was for short-term flips for 2-Family residences. Given that 2-family residences do not represent a major change from single-family housing units, it was interesting to note that people valued mixed-use and multi-family residences higher on the short and medium term than 2-family units.
                    
                    People understand that properties flipped over a longer term horizon represent the highest value and short terms represent the lowest value. This is indicative of the time value of money and the discounting factors where people or organizations willing and capable of holding value for the long term need higher compensation (or annual value) to commit to parting with their investment.
                </figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Flips_3.png" alt="Price Diffentials" width="700" height="550" Title="Price Differentials">
				<figcaption>
                    The dataset presented an interesting variable called price differential which I wanted to explore with my analysis and had not come across before. I plotted the monthly horizon for the distribution and the corresponding price differentials. There is no discernible pattern with respect to the monthly horizon time and price differential behavior. Notable exceptions on the box-and-whisker plot are month 5 with a -$137M and month 22 with a +$125M differential. I had excluded nulls and anything beyond a 24-month horizon to focus more closely on the 2-year time period. The big takeaway for me from this distribution is that the median price differentials are between 0 and $15M, indicating that properties overall represent a net positive impact on prices between flips.

			<figure>
			<img src="images/Flips_BuySide.png" alt="Buyside Flips" width="500" height="500" Title="Buyside Flips">
			<figcaption>
                Next, to further break down the horizon analysis from the previous part, I map the price differential rather than the price to understand buyside flip behavior. This is meant to better gauge flip behavior over the time horizon as the price differential represents the price difference between flips. Consistent with my understanding and previous analysis, buyers prefer to hold properties for the longest duration possible, i.e., 24+ months; hence, this doesn't represent a significant number of properties that are purchased for flipping, at least on the short-term horizon. The differential for this is incredibly high, more than expected, worth $600M. For any duration below 24 months, it represents a positive differential of tens of millions at maximum. Curiously, the purchase of properties represents a positive differential for buyers except in the 24th month and represents an avenue for further study.
            </figcaption>	

			<figure>
			<img src="images/Flips_SellSide.png" alt="Bathroom to Bedroom" width="500" height="500" Title="Sellside Flips">
			<figcaption>
                Contrastingly, the sell-side flips are much more volatile to price differentials than buy-side flips, with the 5-month flips representing a net negative differential of approximately $145M. Flipped property sales do not have a discernible pattern, at least in the short-term. However, similar to buy-side flips, the value is positive for a 24+ month horizon. Flipping property for the purpose of getting higher profits represents a high-risk framework, and such sellers are more sensitive and liable to net negative price differentials. Their behavior represents the trading characteristics but they also recognize the long-term sales and purchase horizon for such properties.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p> I really enjoyed exploring the 'Housing for the Rich' subtheme and the 'Residential Sales' dataset for this assignment. As a novice in this field, I was interested in understanding and establishing patterns related to property prices, investor behavior, positioning, and value of luxury property types, as well as flipped property transactions which represented the four main questions I sought to explore with this assignment. This provided good insight, particularly on the short- to long-term horizon for property buying and selling. Prices are highly sensitive to market changes while generally, housing value is increasing. This represents the difficulty in purchasing property in Boston as everyone realizes the underlying wealth generation capabilities of such investments, however, not everyone can afford to. Since this theme pertained to understanding housing for the rich, I sought to observe investor behavior, who are the primary owners of property in Boston, and what were the characteristics of their transactions, i.e., property type (single-family vs. subsidized housing), cash vs. mortgage transactions, and large investor vs. non-investor, where a higher number of transactions do not equal a higher share of the market. Also, the dataset provided rich information on different housing types that buyers invest in, and with respect to their geographical location and prominence, I wanted to analyze how these properties have been distributed.
                Finally, flip transactions introduced a new aspect to my understanding, providing interesting insights into the behaviors of buyers and sellers with respect to the time horizon. While single-family properties represented the highest value for individuals and organizations, it was intriguing to observe different insights related to other use cases. For example, 2-family housing signified a considerably shorter time horizon than mixed-use properties. This observation shed light on the varied dynamics of the real estate market, particularly in how different property types are perceived and utilized in terms of investment duration and utility.
                I focused my analysis on family use case to understand how it impacts people living in these residences and leave with a richer understanding yet greater curiosity in understanding this societal impact further.
