			<h3>Q1: What indicative trends can we deduce in average annual value of properties for different factors? </h3>

				<figcaption>
					For the residential sales dataset, my starting point was to assess any relationships between average annual values of property compared to prices. For most of the time horizon under consideration (2000-2022), the trends are similar where an increase in average annual value corresponds to an general increase in price. Interestingly, however, both are immune to drastic changes in each other as they don't display corresponidng proportionate change. For e.g. while there was a sharp decrease in prices in 2008-09, likely brought on by the housing market crash, the average annual value did not change respectively. In fact, there was a notable increase felt in the subsequent years. Prices are much more speculative in nature and volatile to external market trends and I saw can see similar behavior here. Additionally, the drastic increase in average annual value also didnt proportionally raise prices as there was a 6x increase in house value in 2017 but this corresponded to only a 2x increase in price for the same year.

				<img src= "images/Subsidized_2_YearlySales&Price.png" alt="Yearly Sales Price" width="700" height="400" title="Individual Transactions Price Over the Years">
				<figcaption>
				The previous graph presented interested findings and I wanted to explore these on their own separate merit. 
				For prices, I was intrigued to find the density of individual sales. This result shows that most of the residential transactions hovered around the $100M mark individually, with the next highest observation in the $100M-$200M range. While reading the asssigned reading <cite> <a href="https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report" target="_blank">Homes for Profit</a></cite>, my initial assumption was that Boston's prices have been high and remain outside grasp of reasonable policy change. 
				However, this data underscored that while most of the transactions are not astronomically priced high to warrant radical and perhaps unsteady policies, sustained and consistent efforts can still achieve results.

				<img src="images/Subsidized_3_YearlySales&Price.png" alt="Yearly Price Data for Institutional Investors" width="700" height="400" title="Yearly Price Data for Institutional Investors">
				<figcaption>
			Given that I am analyzing the theme of Housing for the Rich for this assignment, i wanted to explore the trends for the most affluent investor type; Instituional investors. 
			While the initial trend is consistent with the pricing trends observed in Figure 1, it is incredible to see that in the recent years, instituional investors have undertaken transactions well in the billions of dollars. 2017-2018 saw a significant jump from previous years, buoyed perhaps by Trump administration's tax cuts that have since significantly dropped with the start of Biden's administration.

			<h3>Q2: For the various investor types, what do these sales signify and in what manner do they take shape? </h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_2.png" alt="Count of Investor Transactions" width="300" height="400" Title = "Count of Investor Transactions">
				<figcaption>
				Building off the previous analysis, I wanted to further gauge any insights found and whether the large amount of transactions conducted by instituional investors corresponded with any other result. I was shocked to find that most of the transactions were under taken by non-count investors instead of instituional investors. In fact, non-count investor purchaseds represented roughly 7x the combined count of all others. 
				This seemingly contradicts the findings mentioned in the report <cite> <a href="https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report" target="_blank">Homes for Profit</a></cite>. However my understanding is that these represent the count of actors and not the share of transactions. There must be other factors at play and possibly instituional investors, though few in number, may conduct significantly large transactions to sway the share of purchase to be more consistent with the report's findings.
				</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_1.png" alt="Cash Purchases" width="300" height="150" Title="Cash Purchases">
				<figcaption>
				This chart adds further dimension to the finding above that non-count investors consist of the largest amount of buyers. Consistent with my assumptions this graph represents that non-value investors represents the largest chunk of cash sales.  
				As the Boston Globe report <cite> <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/special-projects/spotlight-boston-housing/boston-towers-of-wealth/"target="_blank">Reckoning with Boston's Towers of Wealth</a></cite> finds, cash sales represent a preferential mode of transaction for both buyers and sellers, especially individual actors. Perhaps the non-investors represent individual buyers and while their number may be exceedingly high, their transactions frequently used cash, underlining their aversion or perhaps lack of access to large financing options.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_5.png" alt="Single Family Housing" width="650" height="350" Title="Single Family Housing" >
				<figcaption>
				Building on the insights gathered in previopus figure, this further confirms my assumptions that instituional investors gauged mainly in mortgage sales vs non-value investors that utilized cash sales options and represented individual buyers. I use a consistent color palette to represent investor types.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_3.png" alt="Primary Owner" width="300" height="350" Title="Primary Owner of Single-Family">
				<figcaption>
					Next, my motivation was to understand the single-family property ownership breakup per investor type. Similar to earlier results, institutional investors are the biggest owners of single-family homes in Boston. Single-family homes represent the greatest value for propertyy owners, as corroborated by the Boston Globe report <cite> <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/special-projects/spotlight-boston-housing/boston-towers-of-wealth/"target="_blank">Reckoning with Boston's Towers of Wealth</a></cite> regarding luxury condos. According to the report, developers  are mandated to provide subsidized housing as compensation for luxury property investments.
					Significant part of Boston's housing is crunched because of sale and development of single-family housing, at the expense of multiple family housing. I explore the property types and locations further under Question 3.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_4.png" alt="Subsidized Housing Ownership" width="300" height="350" Title="Subsidized Housing Ownership">
				<figcaption>
			Relatedly to the point above, this graph of ownership of subsidized housing represents the instituional investors as major owners of subsidized housing properties in Boston. While Medium investor type hold the least amount of such housing, it is worryung that small investors do not own a majority of subsidized housing. This presents risks of evictions and 
			exorbitant rates since the investors are driven by the profit motive, instituional investors primarily so, and this representation not being a democratic one can spell trouble for Boston housing market. I explore this contribution next.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_6.png" alt="Subsidized Housing Contribution" width="550" height="400" Title="Subsidized Housing Contribution">
				<figcaption>
				To understand value of subsidized housing in Boston further and why there's been a push from instituional investors, I wanted to understand if there were any year-wise trends. there was a considerate jump in 2013 as demonstrated by the graph. 
				While for the rest of the years, the housing value were pretty similar, further research from Boston Globe's report in 2013 stated that <cite> <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/02/07/massachusetts-officials-say-million-targeted-for-affordable-housing/nHjjWWcl2LBObiwtM6NSVJ/story.html"target="_blank"> $67m allocated for Mass. affordable housing </a>. 
				This perhaps had buouyed for-profit instituional investors which might have resulted in an extremely high jump in average annual value for subsidized holding and intitutional investor's ownership in such property type. I annotate on the graph to convey the amount of subsidized housing value.

			<h3>Q3: What information can property types inform us about the Boston Housing crisis, how the houses are designed and where they are located? </h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Rich_1.png" alt="Cluster" width="700" height="400" Title="Cluster">
				<figcaption>
				This graphs shows for each zip code, which property type is dominant in the respective zip code. Apartment buildings (APT) and Residential Condominiums (RCD) stand out as the most popular type, prominent to multiple zip codes. Majority of the APT buildings are clustered in the busy Boston Downtown areas while RCD's dominate the suburbs. Since the city center has congestion concerns, most of the high rise buildings are found in this area and the result is consistent with this view-point. Residential condos, however, being more spacious are situated farther away. 				</figcaption>
			</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="images/Rich_4.png" alt="Zip Codes Count" width="600" height="350" Title="Zip Codes Count">
					<figcaption>
					While the above graph gave me the option to better visually imagine the dataset regarding the prominence of a particular property type's dominance w.r.t. geography, I used this representation to showcase the detailed and numerical representation of the amount of zip codes where a particular property type is present. This allows a better comparison between different property types and shows that majority of Boston residents prefer to own Residenctial COondominums. This confirms my earlier asusmptions regarding luxurious housing in Boston.
				</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="images/Rich_2.png" alt="Apt Buildings" width="550" height="350" Title="Apartment Buildings">
					<figcaption>
					Further exploring the APT dataset for Boston proper, I observe that the Dorchestor neighborhood has the most amount of APT buildings. I've annotated on the graph for reference of property numbers. This graphs shows that contrary to general perception, APT buildings are not as prominent in the over-frequent commercial areas of Boston proper such as Downtown, Park Street, North End and Back Bay. 
					</figcaption>
				</figure>				

				<figure>
					<img src="images/Rich_3.png" alt="Bathroom to Bedroom" width="600" height="500" Title="Bathroom to Bedroom">
					<figcaption>
					For the different property types, I was also interested in their constitution, after having developed a good sense of the frequency of their presence and location in the given municipalities. This graph involved calculating the ratio of bathroom and bedrooms to total rooms respectively for each property. It was interesting to note that majority of the property types concentrated around 0.5 i.e. half the number of bathrooms and bedrooms to total rooms present.
					However, R25 was a stark exemption as it showcased an equal ratio of bathroom and bedrooms to total rooms which is 1. R25 is meant to house more than 25 residents to a building and represents a housing type that could include just a bedroom and bathroom for each of its occupants. That is, its meant to be an affordable housing unit without the extra space/amenities enjoyed by other property types such as living rooms, dining halls, etc. What was also interesting to note is that the ratio of bathrooms to total rooms and bedrooms to toal rooms was equal for all property types, indicating adequate presence of sanitary facilities.

			<h3>Q4: How do property flips impact prices between flips, ownership horizon and transactional behavior?</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Flips_1.png" alt="Term Flips" width="900" height="500" Title="Term Flips">
				<figcaption>
				I started my analysis on flipped properties by trying to understand the connection of flip-horizons (or terms) on the average annual value of different family size residences. Single Family and long term flip terms significantly stand out, as expected. Most individuals and investors consider property ownership an investment, eased by rising property values.
				It was interesting to observe that the smallest share of annual value was for short-term flips for 2-Family residences. Given that 2-family residences do not represent a major change from single-family housing unit. 
				People understand that properties flipped over a longer term horizon represent the highest value and short terms represent lowest value. This is indicative of the time value of money and the discounting factors where people or organizations willing and capable of holding value for long term need higher compensation (or annual value) to commit to parting with their investment.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Flips_3.png" alt="Price Diffentials" width="700" height="550" Title="Price Differentials">
				<figcaption>
				The dataset presented an interesting variable called price differential which i wanted to explore with my analysis and had not come across before. I plot the monthly horizon for the distribution and the corresponding price differentials
				There is no discenrable pattern with respect to monthly horizon time and price differntial behavior. Notable exceptions on the box-and-whiksker plot are month 5 with -$137M and month 22 with +$125M differntials. I had excluded nulls and more than 24 month horizon to consider the 2-year time period in further detail. The big takeaway for me from
				this distribution is that the median price differntials are between 0-$15M, indicating that properties overall represent a net positive impact on prices between flips.

			<figure>
			<img src="images/Flips_BuySide.png" alt="Buyside Flips" width="500" height="500" Title="Buyside Flips">
			<figcaption>
			Next, to further breakdown the horizon analysis from previous part, I map the price differetial rather than price to understand buyside flip behavior. This is meant to better gauge flip behavior over the time horizon as price differential represents the price difference between flips.
			Consistent with my understanding and previous analysis, buyers prefer to hold properties for the longest durtation possible, i.e. 24+ months. The differential for this is incredibly high, more than expected, worth $600M.For any duration below 24 months,it represents a positive differential of tens of millions at maximum.
			Curiously, the purchase of properties represents a positive differential for buyers except in the 24th month and represents an avenue for furher study.
