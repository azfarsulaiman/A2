			<h3>Q1: What indicative trends can we deduce in average annual value of properties for different factors? </h3>

				<figcaption>
					For the residential sales dataset, my starting point was to assess any relationships between average annual values of property compared to prices. For most of the time horizon under consideration (2000-2022), the trends are similar where an increase in average annual value corresponds to an general increase in price. Interestingly, however, both are immune to drastic changes in each other as they don't display corresponidng proportionate change. For e.g. while there was a sharp decrease in prices in 2008-09, likely brought on by the housing market crash, the average annual value did not change respectively. In fact, there was a notable increase felt in the subsequent years. Prices are much more speculative in nature and volatile to external market trends and I saw can see similar behavior here. Additionally, the drastic increase in average annual value also didnt proportionally raise prices as there was a 6x increase in house value in 2017 but this corresponded to only a 2x increase in price for the same year.

				<figcaption>
				The previous graph presented interested findings and I wanted to explore these on their own separate merit. 
				For prices, I was intrigued to find the density of individual sales. This result shows that most of the residential transactions hovered around the $100M mark individually, with the next highest observation in the $100M-$200M range. While reading the asssigned reading <cite> <a href="https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report" target="_blank">Homes for Profit</a></cite>, my initial assumption was that Boston's prices have been high and remain outside grasp of reasonable policy change. 
				However, this data underscored that while most of the transactions are not astronomically priced high to warrant radical and perhaps unsteady policies, sustained and consistent efforts can still achieve results.

			Given that I am analyzing the theme of Housing for the Rich for this assignment, i wanted to explore the trends for the most affluent investor type; Instituional investors. 
			While the initial trend is consistent with the pricing trends observed in Figure 1, it is incredible to see that in the recent years, instituional investors have undertaken transactions well in the billions of dollars. 2017-2018 saw a significant jump from previous years, buoyed perhaps by Trump administration's tax cuts that have since significantly dropped with the start of Biden's administration.

			<h3>Q2: For the various investor types, what do these sales signify and in what manner do they take shape? </h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Investor_2.png" alt="Count of Investor Transactions" />
				<figcaption>
				Building off the previous analysis, I wanted to further gauge any insights found and whether the large amount of transactions conducted by instituional investors corresponded with any other result. I was shocked to find that most of the transactions were under taken by non-count investors instead of instituional investors. In fact, non-count investor purchaseds represented roughly 7x the combined count of all others. 
				This seemingly contradicts the findings mentioned in the report <cite> <a href="https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report" target="_blank">Homes for Profit</a></cite>. However my understanding is that these represent the count of actors and not the share of transactions. There must be other factors at play and possibly instituional investors, though few in number, may conduct significantly large transactions to sway the share of purchase to be more consistent with the report's findings.

				<img src="images/Investor_1.png" alt="Cash Purchases" />
				<figcaption>
				This chart adds further dimension to the finding above that non-count investors concsist of the largest amount of buyers. Consistently, to my assumptions this graph represents that non-investors represents the largest chunk of cash sales.  
				As the Boston Globe report <cite> <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/special-projects/spotlight-boston-housing/boston-towers-of-wealth/"target="_blank">Reckoning with Boston's Towers of Wealth</a></cite> finds, cash sales represent a preferential mode of transaction for both buyers and sellers, especially individual actors. Perhaps the non-investors represent individual buyers and while their number may be exceedingly high, their transactions frequently used cash, underlining their aversion or perhaps lack of access to large financing.
