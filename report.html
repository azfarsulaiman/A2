				<figcaption>
					For the residential sales dataset, my starting point was to assess any relationships between average annual values of property compared to prices. For most of the time horizon under consideration (2000-2022), the trends are similar where an increase in average annual value corresponds to an general increase in price. Interestingly, however, both are immune to drastic changes in each other as they don't display corresponidng proportionate change. For e.g. while there was a sharp decrease in prices in 2008-09, likely brought on by the housing market crash, the average annual value did not change respectively. In fact, there was a notable increase felt in the subsequent years. Prices are much more speculative in nature and volatile to external market trends and I saw can see similar behavior here. Additionally, the drastic increase in average annual value also didnt proportionally raise prices as there was a 6x increase in house value in 2017 but this corresponded to only a 2x increase in price for the same year.

				<figcaption>
				The previous graph presented interested findings and I wanted to explore these on their own separate merit. 
				For prices, I was intrigued to find the density of individual sales. This result shows that most of the residential transactions hovered around the $100M mark individually, with the next highest observation in the $100M-$200M range. While reading the asssigned reading <cite> <a href="https://homesforprofit.mapc.org/report">Homes for Profit</a></cite>, my initial assumption was that Boston's prices have been high and remain outside grasp of reasonable policy change. 
				However, this data underscored that while most of the transactions are not astronomically priced high to warrant radical and perhaps unsteady policies, sustained and consistent efforts can still achieve results.
